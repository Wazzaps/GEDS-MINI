twist A,B,C so

A = [0, 0]
B = [?, 0] (Rotate it to be along the x axis)
C = [?, ?] (Rotate it by the same amount as B)

The testing points are (Referred to as P1, P2 from now on)

x    = (distB^2 - distA^2 - Bx^2) / Bx
y1,2 = +-sqrt(distA^2 - x^2)

P1 = [x, y1]
P2 = [x, y2]

Then find the one with the least error factor (Referred to as EF from now on)

EF = abs(sqrt((Px - Cx)^2 + (Py - Cy)^2) - distC)
